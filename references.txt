   - Code Reference: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-labs/blob/main/supporting-blog-content/colpali/04_token_pooling.ipynb

4. Logic Reference (Morphik)
   - Ingestion Logic (Core): https://github.com/morphik-org/morphik-core
   - MCP Tool Definitions: https://github.com/morphik-org/morphik-mcp (Reference for tool signatures, but we build for Elastic backend)

5. Models
   - Main Model: jinaai/jina-embeddings-v4 (Supports both Visual & Text modes)
